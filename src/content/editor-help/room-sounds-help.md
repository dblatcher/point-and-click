**Rooms** can have two kinds of sound playing on a loop; background music and ambient noise. They both work in the same way, but background music is intended to represent sound audience hears, but the characters do not (like the background score in a film) while ambient noise represents the soundscape in the room that the characters can hear - this might be the sound of the wind, traffic or music being played in the distance.

You can us this control to select any sound asset of the right category to be the initial background music or ambient noise for a room.

You can use the *AmbientNoise* and *BackgroundMusic* consequences (in an **interaction**, **conversation** or **sequence**) to change or turn off either sound during the game. For example, you might want some dramatic music to be playing during a particular **sequence**, or a character's action might change the sounds in the room.

Note that you can also have sounds played by particular **Actors** by using *Sound* tab in the actor editor - for example, a fire place might might a sound while its *status* is "BURNING".
