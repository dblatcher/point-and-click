**Rooms** can have two kinds of sound playing on a loop; background music and ambient noise.

You can us this control to select any sound asset of the right category to be the initial background music or ambient noise for a room.

You can use the *AmbientNoise* and *BackgroundMusic* consequences (in an **interaction**, **conversation** or **sequence**) to change or turn off either sound during the game.
