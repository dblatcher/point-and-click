When the player selects a **choice** in a **conversation** a **sequence** will play. You can define the resulting sequence for a **choice** either by creating one from this menu or selecting an existing "external" **sequence** defined in the main **Sequences** editor.

In most cases, it is best to create a **sequence** for the **choice** from this menu, but you may want to use an "external" **sequence** if you want to avoid duplicating the same set of stages. For example - you might have want to use the same **sequence** when the player selects the **choice** "Here, take this key" as when the player uses the *command* "GIVE KEY TO MAN".

If no **sequence** is defined for the **choice**, the player **Actor** will just say the text of the **choice**.
