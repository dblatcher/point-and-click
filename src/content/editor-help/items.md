Items represent anything a character can have in their inventory.

The same thing in the game might also be represented by an Actor which the player can 'pick up'.

 - **name** The display name for the item in the UI
 - **actorId (optional)** The id of the Actor holding the item (undefined = no actor initially holding the item)
 - **picture (optional)** The id of the image asset to use for this item.
 - **row & col** If the picture is an image multiple frames, the co-ordinates of the frame to use.
