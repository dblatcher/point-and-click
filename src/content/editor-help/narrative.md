*Narratives* are textual descriptions of something happening in the game, such as a *Sequence* or an *Order* carried out by an *Actor*.

They are displayed:
 - in text-based mode. If an *Order* does not have a sequence a basic description (eg "Mario does walk") is printed to the feed instead.
 - **TO DO** in narration blocks / transition scenes

 It is recommended to set *Narratives* to make your game engaging in text-based mode.
