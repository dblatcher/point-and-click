**Narratives** are textual descriptions of something happening in the game, such as a **Sequence**, **Order** carried out by an **Actor** or **Consequence** of an **Interaction** or **Conversation Choice**.

They are used:
 - in text-based mode. If an **Order** does not have a sequence a basic description (eg "Mario does walk") is printed to the feed instead.
 - as the text in **Story Boards**.

**Narratives** can also be added to **Rooms** to provide an texttual description of the location in text-based mode.

 It is recommended to set **Narratives** to make your game engaging in text-based mode.
