**Actors** represent anything in the game that can be in a room and is displayed as a **sprite** - whether characters, machines, inanimate objects or anything in between. The player character is an **Actor**.

Like **Hotspots** and **Invetory Items**, **Actors** can be the target of **Interactions**.

**Actors** can be given **Orders** - either as the consequence of an **Interaction**, or as part of a **Sequence**.
