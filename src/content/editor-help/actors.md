**Actors** represent anything in the game that can be in a room - whether characters, machines, inanimate objects or anything in between.

Like **Hotspots** and **Inventory Items**, **Actors** can be the target of **Interactions**.

**Actors** can be given **Orders** - either as the output of an **Interaction**, or as part of a **Sequence**. An **Order** makes the **Actor** say something, move within the **room** or perform some other action.

**Actors** can be moved between rooms or removed from the game world using **Consequences**.

The player character is an **Actor**.
